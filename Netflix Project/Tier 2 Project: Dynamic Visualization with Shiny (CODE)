# OK in this section, we'll show how you can go about doing this using that same data set.  
# Let's say that this time, I want to be able to dynamically show off whereby I want a quick page showing off the cast variable.  
# Specifically, I want to be able to address it in terms of (a) Credited Cast Content vs. Non-Credited Cast Content, (b) Overall vs. Headlining vs. Supporting Cast 

# STEP 1: Get basic skeleton

ui = fluidPage({

  navlistPanel(
    tabPanel(
      title = "All about the cast"
    )
  )

})

server = function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) 

# STEP 2: Create the UI Section in a manner that presents an organization that matches the projected outlook
