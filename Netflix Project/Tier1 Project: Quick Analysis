# Building off of what we already have made earlier, you'll just need to use this section to answer a few key things like: 
# 1) Who's the top actor/director in terms of credited Netflix Content? 
# 2) What's the most prevalent genre or content rating 
# 3) What's the breakdown of English-Speaking and Non-English Speaking Content and if this is statistically significant 

# Obviously there are much more questions you can answer, but these three are a start. 

# ANSWERING Q.1 - TOP ACTOR & DIRECTOR 

netflix_cast_split %>%  # Contains data for both actors + directors already split up
  filter(cast != "Unknown/No Cast") %>% 
  group_by(cast) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%  
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%  # arrange in descending order
  top_n(100) %>% 
  slice(1) # Takes the first option of the already subsetted data frame

# This should give you Anupam Kher as the most credited actor based on Netflix content 
# However, if you want to visualize this, we can go about it like this:
