# This whole part is all about the reading and pre-processing the data for analysis. 

# STEP 1: setting up working directory + loading the necessary libraries for analysis

setwd("~/MyDatasets") # I kept the data set locally, but you can use whatever. 

library(ggplot2) # Used for plotting 
library(tidyverse) # Used for a lot of things and essentially making this whole process easier with useful function
library(tidytext) # You'll realize that we'll need to handle text data which gets SUPER MESSY 
library(shiny) # Yep, we're making dynamic elements
library(wordcloud) # We'll be making some word clouds at some point
library(wordcloud2) # We'll be making some word clouds at some point
library(cluster) # We'll need this in part 3 for making our recommender system 

# STEP 2: Reading the data set and having a quick glance at it.
